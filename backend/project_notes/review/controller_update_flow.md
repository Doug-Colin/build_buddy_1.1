### `findByIdAndUpdate` in Mongoose

The `findByIdAndUpdate` method in Mongoose is used to find a document by its ID and update it. It takes three main arguments:

1. **The ID of the document** you want to update.
2. **The update operations** you want to perform.
3. **Options** that affect the query.

In your code, `req.params.id` is the ID of the project you want to update, `req.body` contains the update operations, and `{ new: true }` is an option that tells Mongoose to return the updated document.

### How Does It Work?

When you send a PUT request from the frontend to update a project, you'll typically send the updated fields in the request body. For example, if you only want to update the `title` of a project, your request body might look like this:

<pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>json</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-json">{
  "title": "New Project Title"
}
</code></div></div></pre>

In your backend, `req.body` will then only contain the `title` field. When you pass `req.body` to `findByIdAndUpdate`, Mongoose understands that you only want to update the `title` field and leaves all other fields unchanged.

### Handling Partial Updates

This approach inherently handles partial updates. If the frontend sends only one or two fields to update in the request body, only those fields will be updated in the database. All other fields will remain unchanged.

### Comparing with `Project.create()`

In the `setProject` function, you're creating a new project, so you use `Project.create()` and pass in all the necessary fields to create a new project.

In the `updateProject` function, you're updating an existing project. You don't need to specify all fields because you might only be updating one or two fields. Whatever fields are present in `req.body` will be updated, and fields that aren't present will remain unchanged.

### Frontend vs. Backend

The frontend's responsibility is to send the correct data to the backend. For example, when updating a project, the frontend should send only the fields that have changed. The backend (your Express API) then takes this data and updates the database.
