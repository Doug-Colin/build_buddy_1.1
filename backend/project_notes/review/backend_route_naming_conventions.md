The difference in the route naming convention between `userRoutes.js` and `taskRoutes.js` is primarily due to the nature of the resources they represent and the operations they support.

1. **Resource-Centric Routes (e.g., tasks or projects)** :

* These routes often follow a RESTful convention.
* `GET /tasks` or `GET /projects`: Fetches a list of all tasks or projects.
* `POST /tasks` or `POST /projects`: Creates a new task or project.
* `GET /tasks/:id` or `GET /projects/:id`: Fetches a specific task or project by its ID.
* `PUT /tasks/:id` or `PUT /projects/:id`: Updates a specific task or project by its ID.
* `DELETE /tasks/:id` or `DELETE /projects/:id`: Deletes a specific task or project by its ID.
* The focus here is on the resource (task or project) and its CRUD operations.

1. **Action-Centric Routes (e.g., user operations)** :

* These routes are more about specific actions or operations rather than CRUD operations on a resource.
* `POST /login`: The action is logging in. It's not about CRUD operations on a user but a specific action related to a user.
* `GET /current-user`: Fetches data about the currently authenticated user. Again, it's a specific action rather than a general CRUD operation.
* The focus here is on specific actions or operations related to the user.

In essence:

* **Resource-centric routes** (`tasks`, `projects`) are designed around the resource itself and its standard CRUD operations.
* **Action-centric routes** (`login`, `current-user`) are designed around specific actions or operations that don't fit neatly into the CRUD model.

For your backend, you can choose the naming convention that best represents the operations you want to support. If you have operations on projects that don't fit the CRUD model, you can certainly introduce more descriptive routes like `/archive-project` or `/duplicate-project`, for example.
