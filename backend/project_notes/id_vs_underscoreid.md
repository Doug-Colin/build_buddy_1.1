In controllers, you may find req.user.id and also req.user._id.

This is becaues they are used for different purposes:

1. **`req.params.id`** : This is used to capture the `:id` parameter from the route. This is a standard practice in Express.js. The `:id` in the route corresponds to `req.params.id` in the code. This is the ID of the project you're trying to update or delete, and it's passed in the URL.
2. **`req.user.id` or `req.user._id`** : This is the ID of the currently authenticated user, which you're getting from the JWT token after decoding it in your authentication middleware. In Mongoose, every document has an `_id` field by default. Mongoose also provides a virtual getter for `id` that returns the `_id` field as a string. So, both `req.user.id` and `req.user._id` are ways to access the user's ID, but they might be in different formats (string vs. ObjectId).

In the controllers of this project:

* We're using `req.params.id` to get the project's ID from the URL.
* We're using `req.user.id` to get the authenticated user's ID from the token.

Both usages are for different purposes, and they are both correct in their respective contexts. The key is understanding the difference and ensuring that you're using them appropriately and consistently with respect to each context, which you are.
