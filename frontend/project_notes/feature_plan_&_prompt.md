Implementing new features:

Okay, so now I need to build the Projects feature of my app. You mentioned the following when telling me what to work towards on my MVP:
"Projects Dashboard: This is the core of your application. Users should be able to create, view, and manage their projects. For the MVP, you can start with basic CRUD operations for projects with the properties you mentioned (client, title, due date, 'ongoing' or 'completed' toggle)."

So, I am trying to outline what I need to do step by step to the backend and frontend in order to get this functioning. I have adhd, so it's very helpful for me if you can help me do this by letting me know if the steps I have identified in order to achieve this functionality on the back and front ends are correct, and if they are in chronological step by step order, and if there are any steps missing.

Since these steps and actions have a lot of detail, I want to first do an overview of the changes i need to make, including files I need to create, and what they do, in each file in the backend and then frontend in order to achieve this functionality.

So that you better understand the structure and flow of my project, please thoroughly look through the file structure and code again: https://github.com/Doug-Colin/build_buddy_1.2/tree/main

Here is the overview of steps I have come up with in order to add Projects MVP feature:

Backend:
-design and make Mongoose schema to define data structure for Projects as projectModel.js
-Add CRUD functionality for projects feature as projectController.js, via express async handler requests
-add routes as projectRoutes.js, and protect them if necessary
-add these routes to server.js in app.use()

Frontend:
-make redux projectService.ts file
-make redux projectSlice.ts file
-make UI for Projects page featuring user auth check, new project button, bulk of this work will be making and connectiing ProjectForm.tsx child component
-make ProjectForm.tsx component with inputs and fields corresponding to the mongoose schema
-make zodSchema for validation of form fields and add validation rules and error messages



Response:
Your outlined steps for implementing the Projects feature are on the right track. Let's refine them further, ensuring they are in a logical order and that no crucial steps are missed.

### Steps to implement projects feature:

Backend:

1. **Mongoose Schema (`projectModel.js`)** :

* Design and create a Mongoose schema to define the data structure for Projects. This will include fields like `title`, `client`, `dueDate`, `status` (ongoing/completed), and any other necessary fields.

1. **CRUD Functionality (`projectController.js`)** :

* Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions for the projects feature. Each function will handle database operations using the Mongoose model.
  * `createProject`: Add a new project to the database.
  * `getProjects`: Retrieve a list of all projects (or based on certain criteria).
  * `getProjectById`: Retrieve a specific project by its ID.
  * `updateProject`: Modify an existing project's details.
  * `deleteProject`: Remove a project from the database.

1. **Routes (`projectRoutes.js`)** :

* Define the routes that correspond to each of the CRUD operations.
* Protect routes as necessary (e.g., only authenticated users can create or modify projects).

1. **Integrate Routes (`server.js`)** :

* Add the project routes to your main server file using `app.use()`.

### Frontend:

5. **Redux Service (`projectService.ts`)** :

* Implement functions that make API calls to the backend for each of the CRUD operations. This will involve using fetch or axios to communicate with your backend routes.

5. **Redux Slice (`projectSlice.ts`)** :

* Define the initial state, reducers, and actions for the projects feature.
* Handle the different states like `loading`, `success`, and `error` for each CRUD operation.

5. **UI for Projects Page** :

* Create a main `ProjectsPage.tsx` component.
* Implement user authentication check to ensure only logged-in users can access this page.
* Add a "New Project" button that triggers the display of the `ProjectForm.tsx`.

5. **Project Form (`ProjectForm.tsx`)** :

* Design the form with input fields corresponding to the Mongoose schema.
* Handle form submissions, ensuring data is sent to the Redux store and then to the backend.

5. **Validation (`zodSchema`)** :

* Create a Zod schema for project validation (`projectValidationSchema.ts`).
* Define validation rules and error messages for each field in the form.

5. **Display Projects** :

* In the `ProjectsPage.tsx`, fetch and display a list of projects. This will involve using the `useSelector` hook to get projects from the Redux store and mapping over them to display each project's details.
* Implement options to edit or delete projects, which will use the corresponding CRUD operations.

Your plan is comprehensive, and the steps are in a logical order. Once you've implemented these steps, you'll have a functional MVP for the Projects feature. Remember to test each step thoroughly as you go along to ensure everything works as expected.
