Backend:

1. **Mongoose Schema (`projectModel.js`)** :

* Design & create a Mongoose schema to define the projects data structure, including fields like `title`, `client`, `dueDate`, `status` (ongoing/completed), & any others necessary

2. **Implement CRUD Functionality (`projectController.js`)** :

* Implement CRUD functions for feature- Each handles database operations using the Mongoose model.
  * `createProject`: Add a new project to the database.
  * `getProjects`: Retrieve a list of all projects (or based on certain criteria).
  * `getProjectById`: Retrieve a specific project by its ID.
  * `updateProject`: Modify an existing project's details.
  * `deleteProject`: Remove a project from the database.

3. **Routes (`projectRoutes.js`)** :

* Define the routes that correspond to each of the CRUD operations.
* Protect routes as necessary (e.g., only authenticated users can create or modify projects).

4. **Integrate Routes (`server.js`)** :

* Add the project routes to your main server file using `app.use()`.

### Frontend:

5. **Redux Service (`projectService.ts`)** :

* Implement functions for API calls to backend for all CRUD operations using fetch or axios to communicate with your backend routes.

6. **Redux Slice (`projectSlice.ts`)** :

* Define the initial state, reducers, & actions for the projects feature.
* Handle the different states like `loading`, `success`, & `error` for each CRUD operation.

7. **UI for Projects Page** :

* Create a main `ProjectsPage.tsx` component.
* Implement user auth check to ensure only logged-in users can access this page.
* Add a "New Project" button that triggers the display of the `ProjectForm.tsx`.

8. **Project Form (`ProjectForm.tsx`)** :

* Design the form with input fields corresponding to the Mongoose schema.
* Handle form submissions, ensuring data is sent to the Redux store & then to the backend.

9. **Validation (`zodSchema`)** :

* Create a Zod schema for project validation (`projectValidationSchema.ts`).
* Define validation rules & error messages for each field in the form.

10. **Display Projects** :

* In the `ProjectsPage.tsx`, fetch & display list of projects using `useSelector` hook to get them from  Redux store & mapping over them to display each project's details.
* Implement options to edit or delete projects, which will use the corresponding CRUD operations.
