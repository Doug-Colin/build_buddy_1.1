Our a simplified `Layout` component renders the Header, MainNav, and Search atop each of the projects feature pages that are accessible to loggin in users, as follows.

Take note:

-The `{children}` prop is a placeholder for any nested components that you'll wrap with the `Layout` component. It's a standard React pattern for creating reusable wrapper components. By doing this, you can use `Layout` to wrap any feature page's specific content, making your code more modular and maintainable.

-In a professional setting, you'd likely only include a wrapper div with a `className` if you needed to apply some global styling or layout rules to all children components. So if you're styling the children styling directly in the parent or the children components themselves, you can remove it.
```tsx
import Header from "@/components/Header";
import { MainNav } from "@/pages/dashboard-page/components/main-nav";
import { Search } from "@/pages/dashboard-page/components/search";

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <>
      `<Header />`
      `<div className="hidden flex-col md:flex">`
        `<div className="border-b">`
          `<div className="flex h-16 items-center px-4">`
            `<MainNav className="mx-3" />`
            `<div className="ml-auto flex items-center space-x-4">`
              `<Search />`
            `</div>`
          `</div>`
        `</div>`
        `<div className="">`
          {children}
        `</div>`
      `</div>`
    </>
  );
}
```
