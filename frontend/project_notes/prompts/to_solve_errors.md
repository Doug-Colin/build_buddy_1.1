Stack Breakdown:

Our app is a project that uses Mern stack, specifically Vite scaffold, React TS, Redux Toolkit for global state management, React Router, headless shadcn components, rich text editing via Plate ( a plugin system built atop and for Slate RTE), and Axios for seamless requests to the backend. The backend is a simple Node/Express server in JS featuring CRUD functionality and JWT authorization & authentication.
