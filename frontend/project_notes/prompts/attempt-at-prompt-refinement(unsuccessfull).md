Initial Prompt:

Thanks.

I initially gave you this prompt:
First, from the perspective of an expert on Prompt Engineering, I need you to advise me on reformulating the following prompt to enable us to use the maximum amount of resources currently available to you, GPT 4, to create the highest possible likelihood of you succesfully providing me with help on the things I need help with, how I'd like you to help me, according to following prompt. This reformulating can take the form of breaking down following the prompt into sub-prompts, and or re-wording or re-phrasing or editing the prompt, and or requesting additional information, code, files, or documentation, and or other approaches that experts on Prompt Engineering advise.

Here is the Prompt:
"
I'm working on a Notes feature for my React Typescript app, which uses Redux toolkit and Plate, a plugin system for Slate's rich text editor.

Here is the current state of the Notes feature:

My editor component, NewPlateEditor.tsx, and NotesDataTable.tsx (a table of user's notes where user can select a note to view & edit) as children of NotesPage.tsx .

When the user clicks a noteTitle in the first column of a row in the NotesDataTable, the note with that title is set to redux global state state.notes.currentNote.

Saving the content of a note is currently functional; the content of redux global state state.notes.currentNote.noteContent is successfully updated on the backend via the onChange of the NewPlateEditor's <Plate /> component by dispatching an updateNote() function from NoteSlice.tsx with the args of the currentNote.\_id and currentNote.noteContent.

What is not functional is loading of the currentNote.noteContent into the Editor upon user selecting a note in the NotesDataTable.

Here is what I need help with:

1. - I need help with making NewPlateEditor modular and reusable, as I would like to add the ability for users to view and edit notes directly related to other features from the pages of those features (when users create new notes they have to associate the note with a Project or Task or Client as opinionated organization of documentation for projects and processes is the core value proposition of the app). When the user is viewing a project or task on their respective feature pages, I want them to be able to quickly access the notes directly associated with said project or task in an editor on that page.

2. -I need help with getting content to load into my NewPlateEditor component.

3. -I need help understanding what approach is suitable for my desired functionality, and how and where props and local and global state should be used.

Here is how I'd like you to help me:

I've found the Plate docs confusing and not beginner-friendly. They advise devs to review supplementary information from the Slate docs, as Plate is a plugin system for Slate.

I'd like you to review excerpts of the documentation from Plate and Slate, and:

A) from the perspective of a highly experienced professional fullstack Dev, advise me on the overall structure and data flow of my app as it relates to the Notes feature and my desired functionality via props, local state, and redux global state, using the information gained from the documentation. I think of that as a professional fullstack dev's 'birds-eye view' or 'overall plan' of the how the feature should be structured. If there's a common professional term for this let me know.

B) from the perspective of a highly experienced professional fullstack Dev, advise me on selecting an approach to the Notes feature and my desired functionality via props, local state, and redux global state, using the information gained from the documentation and the knowledge of a highly experienced professional fullstack Dev. I think of this as a professional fullstack dev's 'implementation plan' for the 'overall plan' in the paragraph preceding this one. If there's a common professional term for this let me know.

C) from the perspective of a highly experienced professional fullstack Dev, advise me on the actual implementation of the 'implementation plan' referenced in the paragraph preceding , actually achieving the desired functionality via custom code using props, local state, and redux global state, using the information gained from the documentation and the knowledge of a highly experienced professional fullstack Dev. I think of this as a professional fullstack dev's 'execution' of the 'implementation' in the paragraph preceding this one. If there's a common professional term for this let me know.

I can include excerpts from the Slate docs on Saving and Loading from a DB (I found the Plate docs confusing and not beginner-friendly, so this supplementary information should help as Plate is a plugin system for Slate), as well as from the Plate docs on doing the same and on 'accessing the editor'.

"

You gave me some advise and a breakdown, but the sub prompts were severely lacking in detail and relevant information. Furthermore, the requests for information were redundant and used circular logic, for example they asked for examples in code of suitable or professional uses of props/state/global state structure, which is knowledge that you should have as it is broad fullstack dev knowledge.

I know you can do better. Provide me with sub-prompts that utilize the information contained in the prompt I gave you, such as relevant file names, technologies used, documentation references, and anything else that will maximize the effectiveness of each subprompt according to the things I need help with and the ways I want you to help me.

Response to above with refined sub-prompts:

Understood. Let's refine the sub-prompts with a more detailed approach, incorporating the specific elements from your initial prompt. We'll focus on the key areas you've highlighted: modularizing NewPlateEditor, resolving the content loading issue, and understanding the best approach for your app's functionality. Each sub-prompt will be crafted to directly address these areas, leveraging the information you've provided about your application, its current state, and your objectives.

Refined Sub-Prompts
Sub-Prompt 1: Modularizing NewPlateEditor
Context: You're using NewPlateEditor.tsx within your React Typescript app, and you aim to make this editor modular and reusable. This component is crucial for editing notes, which can be associated with projects, tasks, or clients.

Refined Sub-Prompt:
"How can I refactor NewPlateEditor.tsx in my React Typescript application, which incorporates Redux toolkit and the Plate plugin for Slate, to be modular and reusable? Considering the editor is used within NotesPage.tsx and interacts with NotesDataTable.tsx, I need to enable it to function across various pages, associating notes with different entities like projects or tasks. What specific changes should I implement to ensure the editor supports this flexibility without compromising its current functionality?"

Sub-Prompt 2: Resolving Content Loading Issue
Context: The application successfully updates notes content in the backend but struggles with loading this content into the NewPlateEditor when a note is selected from NotesDataTable.tsx.

Refined Sub-Prompt:
"I'm encountering issues with loading the currentNote.noteContent into the NewPlateEditor after selecting a note title from NotesDataTable.tsx. The Redux global state state.notes.currentNote is set, but the editor does not display the selected note's content. Could you provide a step-by-step troubleshooting guide or code modifications to ensure the selected note content is accurately reflected in the editor component?"

Sub-Prompt 3: Implementing the Desired Functionality
Context: You're looking for an optimal way to structure and implement the desired functionality using props, local, and global state, informed by the Plate and Slate documentation.

Refined Sub-Prompt:
"Based on the current setup of my React Typescript app using Redux toolkit and Plate, how should I structure the props, local state, and global state to facilitate the desired note editing functionality? Considering the app's core value proposition of organizing documentation, what's the best practice for structuring the data flow to allow users to associate notes with projects, tasks, or clients efficiently? Please provide an architectural overview and detailed code strategies that align with the Slate and Plate documentation insights."

Additional Considerations
Incorporate Documentation Insights: As you've found the Plate documentation challenging and have supplementary information from the Slate docs, the sub-prompts are designed to elicit responses that simplify and clarify these documents' key points, specifically related to your app's functionality.

Tailored to Your Tech Stack: The sub-prompts are crafted to respect the technologies you're using (React, TypeScript, Redux, Slate, Plate) and the specific components and state management strategies you've described.

Focus on Practical Solutions: The prompts aim to generate actionable advice, code examples, or strategies that you can directly apply to your project, considering the existing codebase and your future plans for the app.

You can use these refined sub-prompts sequentially to tackle each aspect of your project, ensuring that the responses are directly applicable to your specific needs and the context of your app's development.

Now, further refine the sub prompts individually by:

- giving GPT the initial overarching prompt and asking for refinement of this individual refined sub-prompts, for a more detailed and specific focus, and by incorporating the information contained in the prompt I gave you, such as relevant file names, technologies used, documentation references, and anything else that will maximize the effectiveness of the individual subprompt according to the things I need help with and the ways I want you to help me.

-asking GPT to use it's 'Additional Considerations' from its previous responses

For example:
