I need your help answering questions so I can create versions of this data table for our app using best practices, in a common sense, non-dogmatic way.  Let's think step by step:

- The goals here are to 1) enable me to learn how to develop code, features, apps, components, pages, and products professionally in order to prepare me for the dev job hunt., and 2) create an app that will be a professional level product so as to prove to prospective collaborators and employers that I can develop software professionally, and 3) create a usable, intuitive, scalable, maintainable app in order to deploy it for real-life use cases and get user feedback and hopefully solve user problems.
- Considering the documentation herein, give me a list of organized actionable steps in the chronological order that a professional developer working on a similar project would undertake them in order to achieve the desired outcome.

-These steps are for a developer with ADHD who learns best by understanding not only how to do something but why it is done that way, so in the actionable organized steps which are organized in the chronological order that a professional developer would undertake them, explain the reasoning behind the approach in the context of best practices.

- The format of your explanation for the context of and reasoning behind the approach used by or in the actionable steps will be explained in the following format:
  '<insert relative verb here, such as but not limited to, Doing, Writing, Undertaking, Creating, Composing, Developing, Building, etc.> + <insert here software development convention such as but not limited to overall approach, OR individual step, OR approach of individual step, OR relationship created between things such as but not limited to software development conventions such as but not limited to components, files, functions, libraries,  tools, code, client, server, development approach, etc.> is considered common sense best practice in <insert language, tool, library, architecture, approach, discipline, industry, role, etc. here> because it creates <insert desirable professional outcome or software development convention here, examples including but not limited to maintainable, DRY, readable, composable, testable, de-buggable, limiting unnecessary renderings, efficient, scalable, etc. > by ensuring <insert  relationship created between things such as but not limited to software development conventions such as but not limited to components, files, functions, libraries,  tools, code, client, server, development approach, etc. here>.

I already created a data-table for my tasks feature. How do I extract this to it's own reusable component?
