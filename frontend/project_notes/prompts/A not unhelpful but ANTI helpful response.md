A not unhelpful but ANTI helpful response, due to the quality worsening exceptionally, despite time invested in optimizing the prompt with explicit and detailed insructions.

This response was the most basic, minimum, lowest-common-denominator type of copy imaginable. Witheringly low-utility information unsuitable even for documents created as background props for fractions-of-a-second long film scenes.

Worse than a generic response, a recursive imitation of a generic response nearly devoid of meaning. An utterly rubbish, trash-heap, bottom-shelf response, of the lowest shelf on the lowest floor of mankinds deepest subterranean structure.

An embarassment less unsatisfactory than pitiful, were it possible to feel pity for the greedy individuals currently striving for the world speed record in product enshitification.
