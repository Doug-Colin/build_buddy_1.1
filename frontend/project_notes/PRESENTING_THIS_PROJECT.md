üìâ  **Kanban** : You're diving into the Notes feature and you've got a time crunch. You're also pondering how to best present this single, robust project to potential employers.

üßê  **Problem** : You're concerned about how a single, in-depth project will be perceived compared to a portfolio of smaller projects. You're also considering the best way to present this project and your skills.

üå≥  **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** : You're transitioning careers and need to make a strong impression quickly, but you lack a traditional dev background or portfolio.

‚ùì  **4 Whys** :

1. **Why focus on one project?**
   * To build something substantial that aligns with your previous experience.
2. **Why worry about presentation?**
   * First impressions matter, especially when you're breaking into a new field.
3. **Why consider different platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn, or a portfolio site?**
   * Different platforms have different audiences and impacts.
4. **Why is work experience a concern?**
   * It's often the first thing employers look at, and you don't have a traditional dev background.

### Actionable Advice

#### Portfolio vs Single Project

* **Pros of Single Project** : Shows depth, complexity, and the ability to manage a larger codebase. It's also more aligned with real-world work.
* **Cons of Single Project** : Puts all your eggs in one basket; if the project doesn't impress, you've got nothing else to show.

#### Presentation Strategies

1. **GitHub** : Make sure your README is top-notch. Explain the problem the app solves, how it solves it, and the tech stack used. Include screenshots or even a video demo.
2. **LinkedIn** : Write posts about your development journey, challenges faced, and how you overcame them. Share milestones of your project.
3. **Web App Landing Page** : A functional web app with a professional landing page can speak volumes. Include a section that explains the app's features, your role, and the tech stack.
4. **Blog Posts** : Write technical blogs explaining some of the complex features you implemented or challenges you faced. Share these on LinkedIn and GitHub.

#### Resume & Work Experience

* **Project Experience** : Treat your single project like job experience. Break down roles you played (e.g., front-end, back-end, database design, etc.) and challenges you solved.
* **Transferable Skills** : Highlight your management experience in fabrication and how those skills are transferable to tech (e.g., project management, attention to detail).
* **Open Source Contribution** : Even a single PR counts. It shows you can work in a collaborative coding environment.

Given your situation, I'd say go all-in on this single project but present it in multiple dimensions‚ÄîGitHub, LinkedIn, a landing page, and even blog posts. Make it so damn comprehensive and well-documented that no one can ignore the depth of your skills and the breadth of your understanding.
