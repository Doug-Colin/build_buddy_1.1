I need to update my resume to apply for my first junior React role at an educational non-profit, and I want your help with it.

 I'm older (just turned 40), so I actually have a lot of work experience, just not in software development. I figured it might make sense then to not only stress my experience building my app, but also my soft skills, as I've beem in many roles where comminication played a central role.,

Anyway, I'll give you some information about me, information about the app I'm developing (which is important to stress since I have no professional experience as a software developer), information about my previous work experience taken from my previous career's resume, an a resume template my bootcamp gave us. I want you to:

- review all of the information about me, my app, my skills, and my work history
- consider what would be beneficial to include in the new resume, and what wouldn't, and advise me accordingly
- consider things that I can highlight, include, stress, mention, or elaborate upon to leverage my decade+ of professional work experience as a manager, teamleader, and liason between departments in my various roles, and advise me accordingly
- Advise me on the resume templates structure and whether it is suitable
- Give me suggestions for how to fill out each part of the resume.


#### Here is information about how I ended up transitioning, or why I am trying to transition, careers:

    I was working as manager of the custom fabrication dept. of a creative design and manufacturing business. Like many small businesses, we didn't have the resources for a dedicated administrative staff, so management and ownership ended up wearing a lot of hats. I noticed that we would lose a lot of time whenever we had to train new or current employees on tools, methods, machinery, an quality control, particulary because we had no documentation.
	I also noticed how much less organized the business was without dedicated admin staff and finely tailored roles or thoroughly designated responsibilities; in addition, operations became increasingly disorganized whenever our production capacity was stressed. I also noticed how much time I was losing because of a lack of documentation on our processes, methods, resources, vendors, and sources.
	I figured that there had to be a software solution to these problems, that would leverage the ability to document, automatically date, sort, and otherwise organize projects and the tasks related to completing them. So I started researching, spoke to a couple of software salespersons, and other managers and professionals in the industry. And there just wasn't a single software solution that understood these needs of small manufcaturing businesesses. Lots of them, including ours, used google docs for everything, but searching the various info related to projects (invoices, assets, vendors, our previous pricing, etc) was tiem consuming. And worse, our processes were not documented, so even repeated projects would often require solving problems that had already been solved, again.
	I already enjoyed coding and in my previous role, had been a CNC programmer and machinist/operator, so I wondered how much work it would take to create an app for this niche myself, and took a deep dive into javascript to build one. I did  a free online bootcamp (maybe not best to mention in resume) and taught myself mujch bneyond that, and my app going well, though not completed.

#### **Here is information about the app I'm working on:**

    The app is a full stack MERN we application. I built a RESTful  API for the backend with CRUD functionality and JWT authentication and authorization using Javascript, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Express-async-handler, and Node. I built the frontend using Typescript, React, Axios for http requests to the backend API, headless UI components from shadcn, react-hook-form for form state management, zod for form validation, and Redux Toolkit for global state management and asynchronous Thunk functions.

It's an app to fil the niche I mentioned before, that aims to improve the productivity and optimize the workflow of small independent businesses in the creative, fabrication, and manufacturing industries. The app aims to do this  by giving them the ability to more easily document and track Projects, processes, and workflow. What I have completed so far in this sense, at least to MVP status, is a linked project management and task management feature. This currently allows users to view, create, update, delete, and duplicate Projects and Tasks, which are linked together. I'm currently working to implement a notes feature using a third party wrapper for Slate rich text editor library (or framework?), which is built on ProseMirror. I heard it's good to mention working with or implementing third-party libraries so that may be good to mention. 

The other parts of the app I built are a landing page, a login page/form, and a register page/form; like the projects and tasks feature, auth is fully functional and working, it's connected to the backend, creating users and authenticating login and storing the user JWT in local storrage to keep them logged in.

Tools and methods I am familiar with aside from all of those include html, css, Figma, git and github, and OOP and Functional approaches to programming.

#### Here is information about my previous work history:

I have over a decade of experience in roles in which communication played a central role, whether it be with clients, direct reports, or across various departments to adjust and approve designs, manage resources, convey the requirements of designs to subcontractors, or identify and explain the benefits and limits of various tools and methods to project stakeholders.

The following is my resume from before I started on thsi software stuff, really, all of my *professional/paid* work experience, atleast the last decade or so:
