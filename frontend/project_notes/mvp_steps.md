Given your goals, the Shadcn dashboard style you mentioned, and the desire for an efficient, scalable MVP that stands out from typical tutorial projects, here's a proposed approach for your Dashboard layout and the projects & tasks pages:

### **Overview Dashboard**

1. **Navigation Bar at the Top** :

* Links: Home (Dashboard), Projects, Notes, Contacts, (later: Costs, Estimates, Calculations, Conversions).
* User Profile Icon: Logout, Profile Settings.
* Central Title: Shows where the user currently is, e.g., "Dashboard", "Projects", etc.

1. **Main Dashboard Area** :

* **Projects Card** :
  * Displays a few top active projects. Each project is a subcard.
  * Clicking a project directs to the detailed project page.
  * "See All" link at the bottom of the card navigates to the projects main page.
* **Tasks Card** :
  * Displays active or ongoing tasks.
  * "See All" link at the bottom of the card navigates to the tasks main page, organized by projects.
  * Later, when you introduce time tracking, you can show a "Total Tracked Time Today" or "This Week" at the bottom of the card.
* **Notes Card** :
  * Shows the most recent notes.
  * "See All" link at the bottom of the card navigates to the notes main page.
* Later, when you expand features, you can introduce:
  * **Costs Overview Card** : Highlights cost trends.
  * **Estimates Overview Card** : Recent or pending estimates.

1. **Optional Features for Consideration** :

* **Notifications Bell Icon** in the Navbar: Alerts for project deadlines, task completions, or cost changes.
* **Quick Action Button** : Floating button at the bottom right for common actions like adding a new task or note.

### **Projects & Tasks Pages Layout**

1. **Left Column (around 30% width)** :

* List all active projects. Each project is a clickable card.
* Active project is highlighted.
* Add new project button.

1. **Right Column (around 70% width)** :

* Displays tasks related to the selected project.
* Each task has its status, priority, estimated time, and actual time.
* Expandable for sub-tasks.
* Add new task button.

1. **Task Details Modal or Page** :

* When a task is clicked, it opens a detailed view.
* Users can edit the task, start/stop the time tracker, view/add sub-tasks, and mark as complete.

### **Considerations & Tips** :

1. **Consistency** : Maintain consistency in your UI elements, typography, and colors. This provides a familiar environment for users as they navigate through the app.
2. **Scalability** : Think in terms of components. As you build the MVP, use modular components that can be reused and extended. This will allow you to easily integrate new features later without a complete overhaul.
3. **Avoid Overloading** : While you want the dashboard to give a quick overview, avoid cramming too much data. Utilize space and consider what's essential for the user to see at first glance.
4. **Feedback & Interactivity** : Provide feedback to the user. For example, use subtle animations for button presses, loading indicators, and transitions between pages or modals.
5. **Mobile Responsiveness** : While you're focusing on desktop now, structure your layout in a way that can adapt to smaller screens later. For instance, the left and right columns on the Projects & Tasks page could stack on mobile.
6. **Unique Features** : As you mentioned, a cost and estimate feature can set your project apart. While they're complex, even a simple version of these features can be impressive. For the MVP, even a rudimentary input-output system where users can log costs and generate basic estimates can be a good start.

Given this approach, for your MVP, I'd prioritize:

1. Projects Dashboard and Tasks per project.
2. Notes.
3. A basic version of the cost feature.

Remember, an MVP's goal is to provide core functionality that demonstrates the app's value proposition. Once you have feedback on the MVP, you can then iterate and add the more complex features.

Once you finalize your decision on the MVP features, we can dive deeper into the steps to implement them.
