# Planning this feature as a professional dev:

### Questions to Ask

1. **What's the MVP?** : What's the minimum functionality needed for this feature to be useful?
2. **State Management** : How will the editor's state be managed? Redux? Local state?
3. **Data Storage** : Will the data be stored temporarily in Local Storage or directly in MongoDB?
4. **Data Schema** : What will the data model look like in MongoDB? What metadata needs to be stored?
5. **UI/UX** : How will the note editor integrate with the existing UI? Any specific UI components needed?
6. **Error Handling** : What happens if saving fails? How will the user be notified?
7. **Performance** : Any concerns about the speed or responsiveness of the editor?
8. **Security** : Any sensitive data? How will access be controlled?
9. **Testing** : Unit tests? Integration tests?
10. **Deployment** : Any special considerations for deploying this feature?

### Actionable Plan

1. **Define MVP**
   * Basic rich text editor
   * Save, edit, and display notes
2. **State Management**
   * Use Axios in Redux Toolkit for global state
   * Local state for temporary changes
3. **Backend Setup**
   * Define MongoDB schema for notes
   * Implement CRUD operations in Express (Axios ineracts with these endpoints)
4. **Frontend Setup**
   * Integrate Slate editor into the existing UI
   * Implement Redux actions and reducers (notesSlice.ts) for note management
5. **Data Saving Mechanism**
   * Implement `onChange` handler to save editor state (in handler, Redux action that uses Axios to save the data to MongoDB.)
6. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   * Add buttons for save, edit, delete
   * Implement loading and error states
7. **Error Handling**
   * Implement frontend and backend validation
   * Catch errors in your Redux slice and update the state accordingly via Axios
   * Reflect that in UI with user-friendly error messages
8. **Performance Optimization**
   * Lazy load editor to improve initial page load
   * Optimize database queries
9. **Security Measures**
   * Implement proper authentication and authorization
   * Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks
10. **Testing**
    * Write unit tests for Redux reducers and actions
    * Write integration tests for the backend
    * Write mock Axios calls when you're writing tests for your Redux slices.
11. **Deployment**
    * Update CI/CD pipeline if necessary
    * Roll out feature behind a feature flag for initial testing
12. **Monitoring and Feedback**
    * Monitor performance and error logs
    * Collect user feedback for future improvement
