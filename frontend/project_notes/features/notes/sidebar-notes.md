Actionable Steps for Implementing the Sidebar

#### 1. **Designing the Sidebar Component**

- **Step** : Create a new component, `Sidebar.tsx`.
- **Reasoning** : Separating the sidebar into its own component enhances readability and maintainability. It also follows the React principle of component-based architecture.

#### 2. **Layout and Styling**

- **Step** : Define the basic layout and style for the Sidebar. Use CSS or a CSS-in-JS library that you're already using in your project.
- **Reasoning** : Good styling and layout provide a better user experience and ensure that the sidebar integrates seamlessly with the existing UI.

#### 3. **Redux Setup for Note Management**

- **Step** : If not already set up, create a Redux slice in `noteSlice.ts` for notes. This should include actions and reducers for adding, deleting, and selecting notes.
- **Reasoning** : Redux Toolkit provides a predictable state management solution, helping to manage the notes' state across your application, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations like fetching from or saving to a backend or local storage.

#### 4. **Integrating with Local Storage**

- **Step** : Implement functions to save, retrieve, and update notes in the local storage. These can be utility functions imported into components where needed.
- **Reasoning** : Before integrating with a backend, using local storage allows you to test the functionality of your sidebar. It acts as a temporary data store.

#### 5. **Fetching Notes on Sidebar Component Mount**

- **Step** : Use the `useEffect` hook in `Sidebar.tsx` to load notes from the local storage when the component mounts.
- **Reasoning** : `useEffect` ensures that notes are loaded as soon as the sidebar is rendered, making them immediately available for display.

#### 6. **Displaying Notes in the Sidebar**

- **Step** : Map through the notes in your Redux state and display them in the sidebar.
- **Reasoning** : Iterating over the notes state and rendering each note in the sidebar allows users to see all available notes at a glance.

#### 7. **Selecting a Note to Display in the Editor**

- **Step** : Implement a function that handles the selection of a note from the sidebar. This function should update the Redux state to reflect the currently selected note.
- **Reasoning** : This enables the functionality where clicking a note in the sidebar populates its content in the editor, essential for a seamless user experience.

#### 8. **Connecting Sidebar to Editor**

- **Step** : Ensure that the editor component listens to changes in the selected note from the Redux state and updates its content accordingly.
- **Reasoning** : This integration is crucial for reflecting the note selection in the sidebar within the editor, making the app interactive and user-friendly.

#### 9. **Testing and Refinement**

- **Step** : Thoroughly test the sidebar functionality. Ensure notes are correctly saved, retrieved, and displayed. Test the interaction between the sidebar and the editor.
- **Reasoning** : Testing confirms that your implementation works as expected. It's crucial for catching bugs and improving the user interface and experience.

#### 10. **Prepare for Backend Integration**

- **Step** : Once local storage testing is successful, prepare the sidebar component for integration with the backend.
- **Reasoning** : Moving from local storage to a real backend is a significant step towards production readiness. It involves handling asynchronous API calls and possibly new state management patterns.

### Next Actions for Further Development

- **Integrate Axios for API Calls** : Replace local storage operations with API calls to your backend for fetching, saving, and updating notes.
- **Enhance Sidebar Features** : Consider adding features like searching, sorting, or filtering notes.
- **Optimize Performance** : As you add more features, pay attention to the performance, especially in terms of rendering and state management.
- **Collect User Feedback** : Once the sidebar is functional with the backend, gather user feedback to understand their experience and further improve the feature.

By following these steps, you're not only implementing the sidebar but also laying a foundation for scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly development. Each step has been chosen considering the specific technologies and architecture of your project, ensuring that the end result aligns well with your app's requirements and tech stack.
