### 1. **State Management for Selected Note**

* **Step 1.1** : In your `NotesPage` component, introduce a new piece of state to track the currently selected note. This state will hold the note's content when a title is clicked.
* **Step 1.2** : Create a function to update this state, which will be triggered when a note title is clicked.

### 2. **Update Notes Data Table**

* **Step 2.1** : Modify the `columns.tsx` to make the note title clickable. Wrap the title in a clickable element (e.g., a button or anchor tag).
* **Step 2.2** : Attach an `onClick` handler to this element that invokes the function created in Step 1.2, passing the relevant note's content.

### 3. **Conditional Rendering of Notes Table and Editor**

* **Step 3.1** : In `NotesPage.tsx`, use conditional rendering to display either the Notes Data Table or the Editor. This depends on whether a note is selected (based on the state from Step 1).
* **Step 3.2** : If no note is selected (i.e., the state is null or empty), display the Notes Data Table. Otherwise, display the Editor with the selected note's content.

### 4. **Integration with Editor**

* **Step 4.1** : Ensure that your Editor component (`editor.tsx`) can accept external content as props and display it.
* **Step 4.2** : Pass the selected note's content to the Editor component when rendering it in Step 3.2.

### 5. **Creating a NoteItem Component (Optional)**

* **Step 5.1** : If you decide to create a `NoteItem` component for individual notes, ensure it can receive a note's content as props and display it in the Editor.
* **Step 5.2** : Replace the direct Editor call in Step 3.2 with this `NoteItem` component.

### 6. **Linking Notes to Projects or Tasks**

* **Step 6.1** : Modify your data model to ensure each note has references to associated projects or tasks (if not already done).
* **Step 6.2** : On the Projects or Tasks pages, implement a similar mechanism to Step 2, where selecting a project or task fetches and displays related notes.

### 7. **UI & UX Considerations**

* **Step 7.1** : Ensure that the UI clearly indicates which note is selected and provide an easy way to return to the full list.
* **Step 7.2** : Consider implementing animations or transitions for a smoother experience when switching between the table view and the editor.

### 8. **Code Organization & Readability**

* **Step 8.1** : Keep your components small and focused. If a component becomes too large or complex, break it down further.
* **Step 8.2** : Use clear and descriptive naming conventions for your functions and state variables to enhance readability.

### 9. **Testing & Debugging**

* **Step 9.1** : Test each component in isolation using a tool like Jest or React Testing Library.
* **Step 9.2** : Debug any issues that arise using the browser's developer tools and React Developer Tools.

### 10. **Documentation & Comments**

* **Step 10.1** : Add comments to your code explaining the purpose of major blocks or complex logic.
* **Step 10.2** : Maintain a README or similar documentation for your project, outlining the structure and functionality.
