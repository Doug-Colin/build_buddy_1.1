## Managing the Tasks and Projects relationship for the user:

* Requiring a `projectName` for tasks is a good idea. It ensures organization and context for each task.

TODO

* Adding task creation within a project context is a good future feature but not crucial for MVP.
* Allowing project creation from the tasks page is a good idea. It streamlines the user workflow.
* A "Creatable Select" component allows users to either select an existing option or create a new one. However, you're correct that projects require more fields.
* UI Solutions:

  1. Vertically split view is a good idea; it keeps projects and tasks in the same context.
  2. "Create New Project" button in the task form is a viable solution. It could open a new dialog for project creation.
  3. Alternatively, a "Quick Add" feature could allow minimal project creation with just essential fields, and users could fill in the rest later.

Choose the one that best aligns with your user experience goals.
