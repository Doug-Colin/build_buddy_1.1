## To Do

### MVP

#### Probably not MVP, be careful!!

* Ability for user to create labels for projects AND tasks adds flexibility (one of the keys here, and should be marketed as such, as bigger solutions seemed to not have it)...
* If a 'type' or 'label' for projects wa maintenance or adminitstrative, it could be beneficial to give the user the option of dueDate 'None' or 'Recurring' and then a schedule sets up. **Def. not MVP.** 

### Not MVP

Adding task creation within a project context is a good future feature but not crucial for MVP.

Making dueDate optional for projectForm? Projects like Maintenance could be ongoing. But something like maintenace for different machines will have very different tasks. (sandblaster or mill or cnc or kiln)... tasks that you would want to be saveable and duplicatable. In that sense, Maintenance  or Administrative makes much more sense as a label for projects, rather than a project name. So:

* Perhaps projects need labels, or 'types'. (Maintenance | Administrative | Client ...?).
* This complicates the notion of Tasks having similar labels... So perhaps projects and tasks could have different labels.
* Ability for user to create labels for projects AND tasks adds flexibility (one of the keys here, and should be marketed as such, as bigger solutions seemed to not have it),
