Group by Feature (or Domain) is particularly useful for larger applications where features or domains are distinct.

Pros:

Clear separation of concerns.
Easier to remove a feature if needed.
Easier to scale as more features are added.

In this structure:

The primary CalculatorPage resides directly within the pages/ directory.
Any components that are specific to the CalculatorPage (and not reused elsewhere) would be inside the components/ subdirectory of CalculatorPage/.
Subpages related to specific calculators would also be direct subdirectories of CalculatorPage/. This keeps all calculator-related pages and components closely grouped, making it clear that they are all related.
This approach ensures that each page and its related components/subpages are grouped together, making it easier to manage and understand the relationship between them
