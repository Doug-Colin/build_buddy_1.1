### **Recommendation** :

Given that this is a capstone project and you're building a portfolio to land your first dev job, here's a potential strategy:

1. **Complete the MVP** : Ensure your web app is polished, well-documented, and showcases your best work. A well-executed project can speak volumes.
2. **Add 2-3 Smaller Projects** : Instead of diving into React Native immediately, consider building 2-3 smaller projects that showcase different skills. For instance:

* A simple CRUD app (to demonstrate backend skills)
* A frontend project that integrates with a third-party API (to show API integration skills)
* A small tool or utility (to highlight problem-solving and creativity)

1. **Consider a React Native Project Later** : Once you have a more rounded portfolio, you can consider diving into React Native. This could be porting your capstone project or a new, simpler app to get your feet wet.
2. **Documentation & Presentation** : Alongside your projects, ensure you have a well-documented README for each repository. Consider building a personal website or portfolio page that showcases your projects, skills, and a bit about yourself.

Remember, the goal of a portfolio is to showcase your skills, versatility, and problem-solving abilities. Quality often trumps quantity, so focus on making each project a testament to your abilities. Best of luck with your job search!



Absolutely! Integrating with a third-party API is a great way to demonstrate your ability to work with external data sources, handle asynchronous operations, and present data in a user-friendly manner. A project that integrates with the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) API or any other weather-related API would be an excellent choice.

Here are some ideas for projects that integrate with third-party APIs, including the NOAA:

### 1.  **Weather Dashboard** :

* **Description** : Create a dashboard that allows users to search for current weather conditions, forecasts, and historical data for a specific location.
* **Features** :
* Search by city, ZIP code, or coordinates.
* Display current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icons.
* Show a 5-day or 7-day forecast with daily summaries.
* (Optional) Display historical weather data or trends.
* (Optional) Add a map integration to visualize the selected location.

### 2.  **Weather Alert System** :

* **Description** : Build a system that notifies users of severe weather alerts in their area.
* **Features** :
* Allow users to register and set their preferred location.
* Check the NOAA API for alerts periodically and notify users via email or SMS when there's an alert for their location.
* Display a list of current alerts on a web page.

### 3.  **Climate Data Visualization** :

* **Description** : Create a tool that visualizes climate data over time, allowing users to explore trends and anomalies.
* **Features** :
* Allow users to select specific data sets (e.g., average temperature, precipitation).
* Display data in interactive charts or graphs.
* Provide insights or summaries based on the data.

### 4.  **Weather Comparison Tool** :

* **Description** : Build a tool that allows users to compare weather data between two or more locations.
* **Features** :
* Search and select multiple locations.
* Display side-by-side comparisons of current conditions, forecasts, or historical data.
* Highlight significant differences between the locations.

### 5.  **Weather-Dependent Activity Recommender** :

* **Description** : Create an app that recommends activities based on the current weather conditions (e.g., recommending indoor activities on rainy days).
* **Features** :
* Detect the user's location or allow manual input.
* Fetch current weather data and suggest activities accordingly.
* Allow users to filter or customize activity recommendations.

Any of these projects would be a great way to showcase your skills in integrating with third-party APIs, handling data, and building user-friendly interfaces. Remember to focus on error handling, especially when dealing with external data sources, as this is a crucial aspect of building robust applications
