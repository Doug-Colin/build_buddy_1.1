Freelancing could be 'consulting', have that there.... transition it to engineering?

MY QUESTION:

I made my resume with the help of a senior engineer friend. Since I haven't had a professional tech role, I listed my 100hrs project as a fullstack role at my previous employer (currently unemployed/laid off). I met someone who is VP of tech at a big company. He asked me to send him my resume, but when I met him, I told him I was unemployed and looking for my first professional tech role. 

while frelancing 'came up freelancing phenominal idea for business'

As far as laid off- "If you were recently laid off.... every company knows what that was like now. You can say laid off, tired of freelancing, and want to join ..."

Leon says this guys not gonna care about your resume. Lean into the real connection and the resume will just be a sniff. It won't matter, send the resume, say it was great spending time, lean into building friend connections.... 

ALSO HE SAYS REACH OUT IMMEDIATELY!!!

-Need another project?  Could add compound miter calc!
-Volunteer with grassroots orgs... /Open Source...
-Attend upcoming freelancing crashcourse, get some clients (Class 15 is freelancing class if you want to review) 
-Leon's niche for 2/3 years was Dentist office websites. Said it was a nice niche, though probably horribly overfilled now.

-What's a new niche? Smokeshops.... any other businesses that have exploded in NY?
-CLAIM UNEMPLOYMENT (See if you already did this week?)
