/*
Equivalent to app/(jots)/jots/layout.tsx

**Purpose**: Acts as a layout wrapper for the jots section of the app, including navigation elements and the main content area.

* **Best Practice** : Showcases the use of specific layouts for different app sections.
* **Data Flow** : Ensures user authentication and renders child components conditionally.
* **Layout/User Views** : Provides a side navigation (aside) and a main content area, enhancing the user experience in the jots section.

How it Works:

This file is more specific than PageShell, tailored for the jots section. It includes MainNav, DashboardNav, and UserAccountNav for comprehensive navigation.
It checks for user authentication and redirects if the user is not found.

Teaching Point:
Highlight the use of conditional rendering and authentication checks in layout files. Also, discuss the role of specific layouts for different app sections.
